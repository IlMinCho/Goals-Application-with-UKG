Description: The purpose of this application is to provide a user-friendly interface for employees to create, track, update, and archive their personal and professional goals. The application also provides an interface for the managers to view their employees’ goals and comment on them. Employees and Managers are the two main user types. The important aspects of the application are user-friendly, minimalistic and scalable.

The end goals of the application:

• Provide a user-friendly interface for employees to track their personal and professional goals.

• Allow Managers to give feedback to, track, and assign goals to their employees.

Implemented Features:

• A user can create or archive goals assigned to them, or from those they manage

• Nearly all fields of a goal can be updated, some conditionally

• A user can search, sort, and filter goals from the main table

• Managers have full edit access to their employees’ goals, as well as the ability to add comments
